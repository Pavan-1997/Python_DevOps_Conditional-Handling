# Python_DevOps_Conditional-Handling

Conditional statements are a fundamental part of programming that allow you to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. In Python, you can use `if`, `elif` (short for "else if"), and `else` to create conditional statements.

## `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is `True`. If the condition is `False`, the code block is skipped.

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
```
